When I was a little girl,
you could say a video game saved my life.
And for as long as I can remember,
I feel like I've been trying to repay that debt.
Unfortunately, making games is rather hard.
Our main project's not going so well,
we're just two naive kids after all.
But Frank...
Even though I know you haven't quite realized it yet...
Some day you'll come to understand.
That the debt that I owe...
We've already paid it forward.

:man
But in the end...
All I did was let you down.
Reality is cruel.

:girl
Frank, I know it's been over 5 years...
But I've made up my mind.
Starting from today, I'll be rebooting and taking charge of the project.
ProxyLIFE will be a success, just like I promised.
Drink some coffee and log onto your computer.
We have a game to make!

:phone
Dear Mr.Frank.
This is a formal reminder that you are in default of your obligation to make payments on your personal loan to LUX Corporated.
Unless the overdue amount of $5000 is received within 30 days.
we will have no choice but to transfer your account to our collection agency.
Please act accordingly.

:girl
Look who finally decided to get out of bed.
Frank, freelance programmer by day,
award winning indie game developer by night.
Though you've been on hiatus for over half a decade now right?
Well, don't sweat it.
With my help, you'll finally finish the game that's given you nightmears for all these years.
But, before we can start...
One of your freelance clients urgently requires you to fix some code.
Open the Folders app.

Find and open the InGamePurchases file.
PlusGameUltra wants to add in-game purchases to their new game.
Can you enable it?
Ok, good.
At least you still remember how to code.
Today I'll be reviewing all of the games documents and getting up to date with where you left the project.
In the meantime, take care of your freelance work.
You should have an email about it.
We'll talk again later.

:Alice
Alright Frank.
Having gone through all of your games documents it's become painfully obvious what the problem is.
All those years of endless development have completely drained your passion and motivation.
You're burnt out.
Frank, you used to be the most hard-working, dedicated person I knew.
Obsessed with making this game a success at all costs.
You need to find that spark again.
Rediscover your inspiration.
Reading your original manuscript would be a good place to start, but it seems to be missing a few pages.
Your task tonight is to find the missing manuscript pages and remember why you started this game.
Good luck Frank.

:mans voice
I'm sorry Dad, but I've made up my mind.
Besides, I've already handed in my withdrawal forms.
My demo was voted the most highly anticipated VR game at VIG 4.
I'm making something special...
And once it's released, it'll be the next big indie game!
Then...
We can finally get mum the care she needs.

:doors front voice
Just ajust the lens...
And, 
you should be ready to go.
Uh, I got to run.
You can borrow the headset, 
I'm sure someone will give you a hand.

:in the wood girl with pink hair
Oh geez, are you alright?
You do know how to use the controller right?
Uh, I only play solo...
But... I guess I can help you get started.

:girl with pink hair
You know, for a beginner you're not half bad.
You might even have potential.
Interesting...

:woman in front of the lake
Welcome back!
Oh my, what do we have here?
:pink girl
Meet Cosmic, I've decided to take her under my wing.
:woman
Well this is a surprise, I thought you were strictly a solo player?
:girl
Uh, I'm just mentoring her.
Can't stop and chat, we're going on a quest to help her level up.
:woman
Have fun!

:Knarf (pink girl)
Another quest completed!
And we got some rare items too!
But damn, I've never seen someone level up so fast.
You nearly logged 500 hours in your first month.

:Knarf
You sure know how to grind...
My parents would kill me if I played that much...
Like seriously...

:Knarf
Alright, I've decided.
From now on, I'm no longer a solo player.
Cosmic, we're officially a party.

:Knarf
Apparently the rumor was true.
The first party to clear the secret dungeon will get a special invitation to meet the devs.
So that's why you've been playing so much--
Ouch!
Sorry, I gotta go.

:girls on the deck
Did you hear about Grant's VR gaming channel?
He hasn't streamed in ages!
Dude, his streaming career is finished.
Shame, he seemed like a nice guy.
I hope he's okey...
I heard he was even a candidate to host the next VIG Festival.

:Knarf
Healing potions... check.
Magic buffs... check.
Cosmic, I think we're ready!
And don't worry,
I'm staying at my grandma's place now.
So... there won't be any more random disconnections.
We'll get you that invitation to meet the devs for sure.

:computer
Our servers are currently experiencing unexpected issues.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused and are working hard to resolve the problem.

:Knarf
Just as we were about to clear the secret dungeon...
And you've been grinding so hard too.

:Knarf
The devs abandoned the game.
It'll... probably even be canceled soon.
Living out in the country with Grandma's great and all...
But there's no other kids my age around.
IsekaiVR was more than a game to me...
It was... an escape.
A proxy life.
:Cosmic
M-My...
Real name...
It's... Luna.
I-I've had this idea..
For ages.
W-want...
Want to...
Want.. to make a game together?

:Jumbo (IsekaiVR developper)
Hi everyone, Jumbo here.
Sorry about the silence.
The thing is...
This game has been a dream of mine since I was just a kid.
Back then I truly believed that it would be something special.
That I was special.
But... reality is cruel.
This game has caused nothing but disappointment and anger.
Making it... was a mistake.
IsekaiVR...
..is officially canceled.

:in the light someone's voice
I'm told it could be the last opportunity we'll have for a while.

:child voice
Look mum, I made pong all by myself!
You can even vs the computer in single player mode!
Now you won't get bored when I'm not here!
:mother
Wow!
You made a game just for me?
You're so smart with computers!
Maybe next time...
You can make a game for others as well.
And brighten up their day,
just like you do for me.
I think that would be pretty special.
:man's voice
Hey, I just got an update from one of the nurses.
She's being transferred to another hospital to be closer to a specialist.
They're going to run some more tests but...
I've sent you some money for flights, we'll talk more when you get home, son.

:man in the lab
Yeah, I ran into him in the waiting room this morning.
It's kinda crazy to think he was top of our class in our first semester.
:woman
I feel bad for him.
If only he didn't drop out and waste his life chasing some childish dream...
:man
I feel more sorry for his parents.
Especially his mum.
He was so talented, he could've really helped people.

:man in the bed room?
Oh?
Your son made that game?
I think I might've played it on stream once.
No, no I'm not popular or anything.
In fact, I'm thinking of quitting once I go to college.
It's just a stupid little dream anyway.
I'll never be successful like any of the big names.
:woman
I-if..
Your s-streams can brighten up the day...
O-of even one s-single person.
E-even just for a moment.
Then I-I think you're already...
...Pretty successful.

:woman
L-Listen...
I-I have... a f-favor to ask.
There's... s-someone I want you to meet...

:man
I'm sorry mum...
In the end...
All I did was let you down.

:girl
Frank
Why did you start this game?

:man
Just adjust the lens...
And... you should be ready to go.
Uh, I gotta run.
You can borrow the headset,
I'm sure someone will give you a hand.

:woman
W-Want..
Want to make a game together?

:man
Reality...
is cruel.
Her dream...
was to make a game for people who wanted an escape.
A ProxyLIFE.
So I promised her...
We would make the game.
And it would be a cosmic success.

:Alice
Rise and shine Frank, we have a big day ahead of us.
Today we're reactivating ProxyLIFE's social media accounts.
Now, I know you're not a fan of that kind of stuff...
But we have to start building a community and accumulating wishlists on the Hazestore.
Those two components are essential for an indie game to succeed.
I need you to search your apartment for game dev related content I could post online.
Designs, sketches, anything.
When you're done, take care of your freelance work and I'll contact you in the afternoon.
And no slacking!
